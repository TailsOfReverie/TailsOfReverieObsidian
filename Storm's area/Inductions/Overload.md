An overloaded induction also know as a "7+ or -2" is a induction involving giving the subject too many things to keep focused on.

the idea behind the name 7 + or -2 is the average person can keep track of roughly 5-9 things at once, So you give the subject something to keep in mind, usually something like an visual or sound around them, and start an almost casual conversation, but this talk isn't just random, each few sentences keep adding in another thing for them to keep focus on.

this is something that doesn't work well for every subject or hypnotist as it requires a lot of mental power on the hypnotist and the subject may not enjoy the feeling of their brain being overloaded, so check before starting.

an example, we'll have this set in an outdoor environment at night, with a campfire as this is pretty common in VR...

> "We'll start with something simple, and I just want you to relax, lay down and look up at the sky, in particular I want you to find a star in the sky and just watch it sparkle, and as we continue just always keep these things in mind"

So far this is 1 things, but they're already doing 2 as they're also listening to you, it may also help to keep a mental note or even writing down the things you choose, but the goal is to simplify it for yourself.

you may choose to take entire control of the direction or even use the subject, you could simply ask "what else do you notice?", maybe they'll respond with the crackle of the fire, or the sound of crickets. continuing with this as an example

> "Wonderful, thats two noises you can hear right now, and I want you to keep listening to them as well, but make sure you're watching that star shining in the sky too, the fire crackling and the sound of crickets in the night."
> 
> "you might also notice a cool breeze going though as well, brushing over your arm and body, another thing I want you to keep track of, keep it all in mind now, the stars, the fire, the crickets and the wind"

At this point we already have 5 things they're focused on (including your voice) the goal is to keep cycling though these focus points while adding more.

> "So now we have a couple of focus points lets talk about sensations, how does the ground feel? your hands, the grass, feel over them but dont forget to keep looking at the sky, each star shining, and the sound of the fire roaring, each crackle, each little detail but keep listening to my voice, keep feeling the wind, and the sound it carries, the crickets in the night, the ground below you"

Once you feel like the subject is getting overwhelmed and overloaded by the multiple focus points of stimulation, you can do a few things, but the goal is the same, reset the brain, right now it has so many things running though it it can't keep up, the brain will follow the easiest option, the path of least resistance, this can be down by changing the topic to have everything suddenly stop, focusing purely on your voice, on your words, and to relax, take them deeper and they'll follow.

the other option is something that'll jolt their brain like a snap, something to break that concertation and then pull them down into trance, once you do this the brain basically resets and will follow with whats easiest, and if you're telling them to relax, and just listen, it's simple and easy.
