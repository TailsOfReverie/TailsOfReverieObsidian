PMR (Progressive muscle relaxation) is a simple and common method to relax people while also priming them for trance.

Start small with having them get a feeling of their muscles in their hand, can use the fact the most nerves are in the hand and we have a good idea of how it feels.

have them start to relax one part of the hand and start to do the same with the rest of the hand before starting to slowly spread or move the feeling along the arm.

Hand > arm > upper arm > shoulders > Back > other arm > chest > stomach > thighs > legs > feet > back up the body > neck > back of the head > face > eyes

Extra attention can be given to parts or just break points to further help the subject relax, notable points being Shoulders and neck

Once the subject is relaxed and in a comfy state, you can express this feeling of calm and relaxation they've gained and move it to a more mental side.

> *"feeling that same relaxation over you body and eyes spread to your mind, letting those active thoughts become more soft, just focusing on my voice and letting everything else fade away"*

from here you can continue with more standard inductions or use the level of relaxation as a anchor, including as a point of reference to keep someone relaxed, or push it further by expressing to have these feelings become enhanced, and the more they relax the deeper they fall into the trance, letting the mind go into a deep and relaxed state, this can be paired or used as a deepener.
