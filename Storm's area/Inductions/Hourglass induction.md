This induction may start with another induction such as [[PMR]]

start with asking the subject to imagine in their mind, an hourglass, the size doesn't particularly matter, filled with sand on one side, simply waiting.

Note that the bottom of the hourglass is always trance, always falling, always sinking.
As grains of sand fall, the feelings of trance will amplify, almost like a count down from 10 to 0

the speed can be whatever the subject desires, once the hourglass is flipped, the sand will start to drain from the top to the bottom side, with the top side being consciousness, and the bottom trance.

the sand falling to the bottom side may even be heard, grains of sand falling, shushing like sounds, softened and muted by the glass surrounding it, it can be heard rustling down the chamber, almost like static, static that interferes, blocks signals and thoughts, drowned out by the soft sand falling down.

of course once the sand has all fallen from the top to the bottom chamber, things may become quiet and peaceful, allowing you to focus on the given task, weather it be listening to the tist words or a given duty, such as maid work, and if you ever feel this state of mind starting to fade, we can simply bring back that same hourglass and flip it over, allowing the sand to once more begin to fall, and sink, back to the simple thoughts and deep trance state.
