Often a simple back and forward motion of an object or even yourself can pull peoples attention and focus it on you, words can be entirely optional as their focus is on your body and you can motion for them to follow it.

this can further be enhanced if something like a screenspace is pulling to look directly at you, giving a sensation of required focus, doing this you can either use a hand/finger or even your whole body, use the space around you as a guide for the subject, start out slow and slowly have movements become more exaggerated, this is effected if they're following your head rock side to side and each time you slowly go further and further and then start to dip your head down as if falling into trance yourself, and the subject will often follow and fall into trance, from here you can continue with other inductions or try keep it non verbal with motions, but do note their head is most likely looking down at this point and will require you to move to be seen, if continuing with vocals, it might be best to start with speaking softly to not startle them from the non verbal state.
